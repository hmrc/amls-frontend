AMLS Notification Package Template Versioning
=============

**Business Background**

* AMLS notification template packages are version controlled, so that a change to the wording in the template used, is only reflected in future messages, and other messages continue to use their original version of the template.

* It will potentially create legal issues if the wording shown on an occasion in the past differs from what is displayed currently.

**Technical Background**

* Whenever a AMLS notification is sent to the customer, a message is sent from ETMP through to amls-notification which stores the summary information, along with the current package version number which is currently active in its Mongo database

* All of the templates are packaged together under a version number within amls-frontend, with an associated script to handle the upversioning (detailed below).

* In order to ensure that the templates for a previous version are not changed by accident, each one is tagged with a magic number calculated based on its contents. Should this number change for a previous version then the unit tests will automatically fail.

* The version numbers are in the format v{`MAJOR`}m{`MINOR`}, starting from v1m0.


Creating a new package template version
=============

**To create a new Major version :-**

* Run the script below from the amls-frontend directory, this will create a new major package, copy the existing templates and unit tests into it.
```
$ upversion-templates.sh
```

* Make the change to the template you want to change
* Run the unit test using `testOnly NotificationsCheckSumSpec` and look for the line `Replace checksum for ${versionNumber}/${fileName} with ${ checkSum }`
* update the magic number in the relevant file in ./conf/notifications/`{ versionNumber }` with the checksum and rerun the test



**To create a new Minor version :-**

* Run the script below from the amls-frontend directory, this will create a new minor package, copy the existing templates and unit tests into it.
```
$ upversion-templates.sh minor
```

* Make the change to the template you want to change
* Run the unit test using `testOnly NotificationsCheckSumSpec` and look for the line `Replace checksum for ${versionNumber}/${fileName} with ${ checkSum }`
* update the magic number in the relevant file in ./conf/notifications/`{ versionNumber }` with the checksum and rerun the test


**Finally :-**
* The package numbers located at the top of each file need to be amended to whichever new package you have created, this will need to be done in any new spec files, the view files and finally the message details service. "All of these being the specific files you created using the script above"
* The NotificationsCheckSumSpec contains a fixture with a val "versionNumbers" inside it. You will need to add to this whichever new version you have created, whether it be major or minor.


Deployment considerations
=============

* **Its important that amls-frontend is deployed prior to amls-notification (to ensure the newly versioned templates are available)**
* Once you ready to deploy then change the `microservices.services.current-template-package-version` in the correct `app-config` (e.g. `app-config-qa`) and then re-deploy the last package
